# RethinkDB-Model-Deserialization

This is just a concept. Nothing more. Hope you find these classes useful or inspiring.

If ever you find any major vulnerabilities or ways to improve the code, let me know or make an issue.
> I know that with recursivity, the "asRoot" feature of the @RethinkObject can be easily broken, but tbh I don't think it's that big of an issue.
